Creating a High-Level Design (HLD) for a WhatsApp-like messenger that supports showing online/typing status, group calling, video calling, and last seen, while supporting millions of users, involves several considerations regarding scalability, reliability, and performance. Here’s an HLD for such a system:

### 1. Overview
WhatsApp-like messaging application that supports:
- Text messaging with online/typing status
- Last seen functionality
- Group calling (voice and video)
- Individual voice and video calling
- Scalability to support millions of users

### 2. Architecture Components
- **Client Application**: Mobile apps (iOS, Android), Web client, Desktop apps.
- **Backend Services**: Responsible for message routing, user authentication, presence management, call handling, etc.
- **Database**: Stores user data, message history, presence information, call logs, etc.
- **Notification Service**: Push notifications for message and call alerts.
- **Media Server**: Handles media upload/download and streaming.
- **Real-Time Communication Server**: Manages real-time messaging, presence information, and calls (voice and video).

### 3. Key Modules and Interactions
#### 3.1. Client Application
- **User Interface**: Chat screens, contacts, settings, call screens.
- **Message Handling**: Sending/receiving messages, media handling.
- **Authentication**: User login/logout, session management.
- **Push Notifications**: Real-time message and call alerts.
- **Presence Management**: Online/typing status, last seen.
- **Call Management**: Initiating and managing voice/video calls.

#### 3.2. Backend Services
- **Authentication Service**: Manages user sign-up, login, and authentication tokens.
- **Message Service**: Handles sending, receiving, and storing messages.
- **Presence Service**: Tracks and updates online/offline status, typing indicators, and last seen.
- **Call Service**: Manages voice and video calls, including group calls.
- **Media Service**: Manages media uploads/downloads and streaming.
- **Notification Service**: Sends push notifications via FCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging) or APNs (Apple Push Notification Service).

#### 3.3. Database
- **User Database**: Stores user profiles, contacts, status.
- **Message Database**: Stores message history.
- **Presence Database**: Stores presence information (online/typing status, last seen).
- **Call Database**: Stores call logs and metadata.
- **Media Database**: Stores media metadata and links to actual media files.

### 4. Detailed Design
#### 4.1. Client Application
- **Architecture**: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) for maintainability.
- **Data Synchronization**: Sync messages, media, and presence information in real-time with backend.
- **Security**: End-to-end encryption for messages, media, and calls.

#### 4.2. Backend Services
- **Microservices Architecture**: Each service (auth, messaging, presence, call, media) runs as a separate microservice.
- **API Gateway**: Single entry point for all client requests, handles routing to appropriate services.
- **Load Balancer**: Distributes incoming requests across multiple servers for scalability.

#### 4.3. Real-Time Communication
- **Protocol**: Uses WebSocket for real-time communication.
- **Scalability**: Employs a distributed system with multiple WebSocket servers and a load balancer.
- **Presence Updates**: Use publish/subscribe pattern (e.g., Redis Pub/Sub) to distribute presence updates efficiently.

#### 4.4. Media Handling
- **Storage**: Uses cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3) for media files.
- **Streaming**: Media server supports streaming for video and audio files.
- **CDN**: Content Delivery Network for efficient media delivery.

#### 4.5. Voice and Video Calling
- **Protocol**: Uses WebRTC for peer-to-peer voice and video communication.
- **Signaling Server**: Manages call setup, teardown, and control signaling.
- **TURN/STUN Servers**: Facilitates NAT traversal for peer-to-peer connections.
- **SFU (Selective Forwarding Unit)**: For group calls, forwards media streams to participants, optimizing bandwidth.

### 5. Data Flow
1. **User Registration/Authentication**:
   - User registers with a phone number.
   - Authentication service verifies the number via SMS code.
   - User data is stored in the user database.

2. **Sending a Message**:
   - User sends a message from the client app.
   - Message is encrypted on the client side.
   - Encrypted message is sent to the message service via API Gateway.
   - Message service routes the message to the recipient’s device in real-time via WebSocket.
   - Message is stored in the message database for history.

3. **Updating Presence Information**:
   - User’s online status, typing status, and last seen are updated in real-time.
   - Presence service uses a publish/subscribe system (e.g., Redis Pub/Sub) to notify other users of status changes.

4. **Making a Voice/Video Call**:
   - User initiates a call from the client app.
   - Call setup and signaling are handled by the signaling server.
   - WebRTC establishes a peer-to-peer connection for the call.
   - For group calls, media streams are routed through an SFU.
   - Call metadata is stored in the call database.

5. **Media Upload/Download**:
   - User uploads a media file.
   - Media file is sent to the media service, which stores it in cloud storage.
   - Media service returns a link to the stored media.
   - Link is sent in a message to the recipient.
   - Recipient downloads the media file using the link.

6. **Notifications**:
   - When a message or call is received, the notification service triggers a push notification.
   - Push notification is sent to the recipient’s device via FCM/APNs.

### 6. Technologies and Protocols
- **Programming Languages**: Java (backend), Kotlin/Swift (mobile), JavaScript (web).
- **Frameworks**: Spring Boot (backend services), React Native (mobile), React (web).
- **Real-Time Communication**: WebSocket (messaging), WebRTC (voice/video calls).
- **Databases**: 
  - SQL (e.g., PostgreSQL) for relational data.
  - NoSQL (e.g., Cassandra) for high-throughput data like message history.
  - Redis for caching and real-time presence updates.
- **Cloud Services**: AWS S3 for media storage, AWS RDS for relational database, AWS EC2 for server instances.
- **Load Balancing**: Nginx or AWS ELB.
- **Containerization**: Docker, Kubernetes for orchestration.
- **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ or Kafka for message queuing.
- **Security**: TLS for encryption in transit, End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) for messages and calls.
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana for monitoring and alerting.

### 7. Scalability and Availability
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Adds more instances of microservices as load increases.
- **Database Sharding**: Splits database into smaller, more manageable pieces.
- **Replication**: Uses database replication for high availability.
- **CDN**: Uses a Content Delivery Network for efficient media delivery.

### 8. Monitoring and Maintenance
- **Logging**: Centralized logging for all services.
- **Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of service health and performance (e.g., using Prometheus, Grafana).
- **Auto-scaling**: Automatically adjusts resources based on load (e.g., using Kubernetes).

This HLD provides a comprehensive overview of the architecture, key components, technologies, and protocols needed to design a WhatsApp-like messenger that supports millions of users.
